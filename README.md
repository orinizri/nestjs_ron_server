## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This project is tailored to Ron, a multilingual notary, to streamline client management while preserving his personal folder structure, as he id used to work. The system uploads files to an S3 bucket, tracks changes, and maintains an updated record of client progress. The aim is to ensure Ron can monitor client stages efficiently without unnecessary manual work.

## üöÄ Future Plans <a name = "future_plans"></a>

Here is a step-by-step plan for incremental improvements:

### Immediate Goals  
1. **File Upload and Metadata Tracking**  
   - Upload files from local folders to the S3 bucket without changing their structure.  
   - Save file names and timestamps to track updates or unnecessary changes.  

2. **Basic Client Status Updates**  
   - Add a column in the database to track client status like:  
     - Document submission (yes/no).  
     - Signed price offers (yes/no).  

3. **Automated Email/Ron App Reminders**  
   - Implement a system to send reminders to clients with pending responses or incomplete tasks.

### Near-Term Goals  
4. **Inline Monitoring System**  
   - Design a simple web interface to show:  
     - The progress of document submission.  
     - Status updates for each stage of the client process.  

5. **Dashboard for Trends and Workload Analysis**  
   - Provide basic charts to show:  
     - Monthly or yearly client intake.  
     - Common bottlenecks or delays in the process.  

6. **Error Notifications**  
   - Notify Ron of any incomplete uploads or issues in file processing.

### Long-Term Goals  
7. **Mobile-Friendly Monitoring**  
   - Build a mobile-friendly web app for on-the-go tracking of client status.  

8. **AI-Driven Analytics**  
   - Integrate machine learning to predict delays and recommend actions to speed up processes.  

9. **Advanced Notifications**  
   - Use client trends and metadata to anticipate and alert Ron of common issues like missing client responses.
